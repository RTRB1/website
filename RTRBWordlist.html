it.

Changes and Updates
</h2>
<p>
Added words are often attested and supported by <a href="https://www.wiktionary.org">Wiktionary</a>
entries, though sometimes words may exist in various literatures and not yet be in Wiktionary. 
</p>
<p>
Removed words are (often) abbreviations and initialisms that have accidentally been added,
although some phony words may be in the list. However, in order to maintain compatability between
the Bookworm games, words that are in any Bookworm game will be kept in the wordlist. This includes
proper nouns like JULIE and CHUZZLE, acronyms and initialisms like LBWS and CYUL, and misspellings
like DENTALIUA.
